terminal path indicator changes to ~ when you're within your home folder

can move multiple files by separating with spaces until folder name

mv both moves and renames files

standard out is the terminal by default

can ls > list as output redirection to a file called list

use cat list to view list contents

cat - but itself repeats everything back to you

cat > welcome
hello
ctrl-d

careful, becaause repeating above over-writes

cat >> welcome to Append

cat < welcome
- reads from welcome and outputs to terminal
- redirect input to terminal

cat < welcome > welcome1
ls shows new file with same contents

"cat" is short for "concatenate"
cat welcome welcome1 > test

OR

cp welcome welcome2

rm to remove welcome
rm -f to forcibly remove in Linux; macOS terminal doesn't request confirmation

man rm for more argument options

man -s 1 -k remove (1 is section 1 for general commands, k is for keyword)

FIRST ACTIVITY

Activity 0

wc is for word count
3 lines
4 words
16 bytes

wc -l
only shows num of lines entered so far

pipes - consume instead of 

cat welcome1 | wc -l (get lines in welcome1)

cat | wc -l
enter a bunch of lines
ctrl-d
then it will process the wc -l

wget https://cdn.cs50.net/2021/x/seminars/linux/shows.csv

macOS use curl instead of wget

less shows.csv
J key lets you scroll line by line
K key scrolls up line by line
spacebar skips to next page
B key goes back to previous page
G back to top of file
Shift-G to bottom of file

use / then the first word you want to find then enter and it'll jump to that
use n for next match
use Shift-n for previous match
-i makes it ingore case
do /the again and it finds any case matches
/Game of Thrones

FIRST FEW LINES OF FILE
head shows.csv
head -n 28 shows.csv

cat shows.csv | head

LAST LINES
tail shows.csv

head shows.csv > first10lines

wc -l shows.csv

less shows.csv

GET ONLY CERTAIN FIELDS/COLUMNS
cut lets you specify fields you want

cut -d , -f 1 shows.csv (, is separator, and only want column 1)
cut -d , -f 2 shows.csv 

cut -d , -f 2,3 shows.csv

cut -d , -f 2,3 shows.csv | head

single quotes if delimiter confuses bash

SORTING
sort -n shows.csv

sort -n shows.csv > shows_sorted.csv

less shows_sorted.csv

SEARCH FILE WITHOUT OPENING
grep Friends shows.csv
grep friends shows.csv (doesn't work since case-sensitive)
grep -i friends shows.csv (to make case insensitive)
grep -i 'game of thrones'
grep '^28' (regex for starts with 28)

EASE REPITION
alias igrep='grep -i'
igrep friends shows.csv
not persistent, only for this session

HISTORY COMMAND
up arrow
down arrow
ctrl-R to search 
enter history
history | head
history | tail

FIND FILE OR FOLDER
find /usr -name 'cs50*' (search usr folder for files named like that pattern)

SED
Fixing mispelling without OPENING
sed fixes part of a file without opening
sed 's/Seinfled/Seinfeld/' shows.csv | igrep sein
sed -i 's/Seinfled/Seinfeld/' shows.csv FIXES FILE IN PLACE
OR
sed -i 's/Seinfled/Seinfeld/' shows.csv > shows-fixedSein.csv TO MAKE ANOTHER FILE

LAST ACTIVITY
